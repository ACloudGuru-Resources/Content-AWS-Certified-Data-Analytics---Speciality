# AWS CERTIFIED DATA ANALYTICS SPECIALTY
An A Cloud Guru Course - 
[AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty](https://acloud.guru/overview/312375cd-c136-4f1c-81dc-dbdcfff2d06b)

In late 2019, AWS announced that they would be renaming the AWS Big Data Specialty certification to the AWS Data Analytics specialty certification. With these changes there are some carry over topics but many of the topics are brand new and more in-depth. This course is designed and tailored to teach you the new services and tools that you can use in AWS to build data analytics applications, as well as build and manage the lifecycle of collecting, storing, processing, and visualizing your data. 

Just because the name of the certification is changing doesn’t mean big data is going away. In fact, data is growing for organizations at an alarming rate and that means there is a growing need for engineers who know how to gather insight from that data. That is where the AWS Data Analytics Specialty certification fits into the picture. This certification validates a deep understanding of AWS data analytics services and understands how they integrate with each other. Once you have passed the exam you should be able to explain how AWS data analytics services fit in the data life cycle and answer important questions your organization's data is providing. 

Join us in the course where we cover major tools, topics, and services needed for a successful data analytics pipeline, help you gain hands on experience, as well as help you pass the exam. So when you’re ready, join us in the AWS Data Analytics Specialty course!
